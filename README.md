**Assessment Details:**

**Task:** Create a responsive team portfolio webpage.
**Objective:** The webpage should include sections for each team member, containing the following:
- Name
- Role/Title
- Contact information (email or social media links)
- Profile picture
- When a user clicks on a team member, navigate to a separate page that provides detailed information about that team member.

**Requirements:**

Implement a responsive design that adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
Ensure the webpage is accessible, with proper use of semantic HTML elements and alt text for images.
Include interactivity using JavaScript, such as hover effects on team member cards and navigation to detail pages.
Use CSS to maintain a consistent and visually appealing design. Ensure that the webpage follows a cohesive color scheme and typography.
Optimize images and other resources for performance.
Handle data dynamically by fetching team member details from a JSON file or mock API.
Note: The webpage does not require an elaborate or colorful design. You may use any dummy text and avatars or placeholder images for profile pictures.
 
**What We Are Looking For:**

- Clean Code: Demonstrate well-organized, readable, and maintainable code.
